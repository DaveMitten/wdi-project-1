<h1>WDI - Project - 1 GuITar HERoKU</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Here is a simple arcade game. It involves basic ideas with sleek design that provides game that a game you can play again and again. It follows a colour scheme that brings back the retro games of Atari and other popular arcade games. Each element ties in to increase the gaming experience.

<h2>How to play</h2>

The gamer is presented with a window that asks them to 'Insert Coin Click to Play!'. When the gamer clicks the window the game begins. There is a 'lives' window to the top left that allows gamer to keep track of lives and a window to the top right keeps track of the gamers score. 

You use the 'z, x, c, v, b' to collect points by pressing them as the balls 'notes' cross through the boxes. Each ball is worth 1 point.

Difficulty increases as time goes on increasing the speed the balls drop and at the rate in which they are created.

Failure occurs when all lives are terminated. The gamer, although defeated can try again after seeing their score to try and beat it.
